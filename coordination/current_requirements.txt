Fix Playwright E2E Tests - Make Them Pass

CONTEXT:
- Previous orchestration completed: Login investigation with 5 root causes fixed
- Backend authentication verified working via curl
- 20 Playwright E2E tests created
- Current status: Only 1/20 tests passing

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Base URL not configured in Playwright config
2. Tests trying to navigate to relative URLs without base
3. Frontend configuration issues  
4. Some tests showing frontend stuck in loading state

REQUIREMENT:
Playwright tests MUST pass to verify full login workflow works end-to-end, including accessing protected functionality after login. This is not optional - tests must actually pass and verify real app functionality.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All 20 Playwright tests passing
- Tests verify real authenticated app functionality
- No frontend stuck in loading state
- Proper base URL configuration
- Tests can access protected resources after login
